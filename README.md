**What do we need to materialize?**
1. We need to choose a GPS Tracking Device to be used for our Fleet Management System.
2. We need to find a specific vendor that can give us the functionality we need for our own system via integrating the GPS Tracking Device capabilities.
3. Our initial costing.
4. Learn about our competitors.

1. Overview of the functionalities.

- Wavecom Fast Track GSM Modem (price range 2800 to 3000 pesos)

## Web Based Application

- Programming Language: PHP (Tentative)
- Scripts: Webpack, ExpressJS

**Things to consider where to deploy the application (Domain Registration/Hosting)**

**Outsource:**
1.	Monthly / Yearly Subscription
2.	Web Traffic Cost (Maximum Allocated Bandwidth) it will depend on how many users will connect through our application. (Included in the bundle but might get additional charges if exceed)
3.	99% Uptime. No Maintenance Cost.

**Internal:**
1.	Installation Cost
2.	Network Hardware Device Cost
3.	Server & Maintenance Cost


## For Web Domain Registration/Hosting

**Source:** [Phalcon PHP Hosting] (https://phalconphp.com/en/hosting)

- Amazon Web Services: (price depends on what type of service)
- ASPnix: (price ranging from $15 to $35 / Year)
- DigitalOcean:  (price ranging from $5 to $80 / Year)
- Fortrabbit: (price ranging from $5 to $30 per App Monthly)
- Linode: (prince ranging from $5 to $80 / Month)
- WebFaction: (price ranging to $10 to $240 / Month)
- Windows Azure: (price ranging to $13 to $261 / Month)

**Note: There are some hosting provider that does not include a domain name registration so it might be different on the actual cost. Of course I will prefer that we will purchase a bundle that includes both. On purchasing a web hosting first we will purchase a small bundle then we scale up our bundle subscription as we scale up our system.**

## How this thing works?

- Once we acquire a GPS Tracking Device we need to install it on the vehicle. The device must also have a sim card installed. On initial testing there are commands (built-in on the device) that we can send through sms and the device will send us back a message about its location (coordinates Latitude and Longitude). Now on integration on our system application (web based) we also need a device connected to the computer that can receive a sms which is the use of gsm modem then the system application will save its received information through our database and also to have a history of its previous locations.
